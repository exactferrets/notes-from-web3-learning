# notes-from-web3-learning

Random notes from what I'm learning in Web3, Farcaster, Frames, and beyond.

## ðŸ’¡ Topics I'm exploring:

- What are Frames and how they work
- How Farcaster handles identity
- What the hell is an OP Stack
- Why Gas is annoying (but makes sense)

> Just a raw dump of curiosity.
